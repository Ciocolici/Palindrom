# Palindrom
A C# (CSharp) WPF Application exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. My very first one. The program checks if the provided word or sentence is the same, regardless of which side it is read from.

*To run the WPF Application program directly, launch "Palindrom.exe" located in "Palindrom/bin/Release/net7.0-windows".*

*Note: german language used.*
