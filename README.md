# Palindrom

A C# WPF Application exercise project, developed during my retraining as an IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. This was my very first WPF project. The application checks whether the entered word or sentence is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward and forward.

Before checking, the app filters out any non-letter characters and compares the result in a case-insensitive way.

## How to Run

To run the WPF Application program directly, launch `Palindrom.exe` located in `Palindrom/bin/Release/net7.0-windows`.

**Note:** German language used.

**The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.**
