# Palindrom
A C# (CSharp) WPF Application project. My very first one. The program checks if the provided word or sentence is the same, regardless of which side it is read from.

Open "Palindrom.sln" to see the code. To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch "Palindrom.exe" located in "bin/Release/net7.0-windows".

Note: german language used.
